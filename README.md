# GraphQL Composite Schemas Working Group

This working group is a subcommittee of the
[GraphQL Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg) with the
following primary purpose:

> To build a specification that covers many of the shared concerns when building
> a larger GraphQL schema as a composite of many smaller GraphQL schemas.

Anyone in the public GraphQL community may attend a meeting of this
subcommittee, provided they first sign the
[Specification Membership Agreement](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/tree/main/membership)
or belong to an organization which has signed.

This repository holds [agendas](./agendas) and [notes](./notes) for all meetings
past and upcoming as well as [shared RFC documents](./rfcs). Anyone may edit an
upcoming event's agenda to _attend_ or _propose an agenda item_.

All meetings occur via video conference, however participating company offices
are welcome to host guests.

Meetings are typically scheduled at 1500 UTC on the 2nd Thursday of the month.
Check the [agendas](./agendas) for the exact date and time of upcoming meetings.

### Want to help us keep up?

We're always looking for volunteers to help take notes from the meetings, the
results of which are shared in [`notes/`](./notes). If you're interested in
taking notes, sign up for a meeting in [`agendas/`](./agendas) and indicate that
you're willing to be a note taker.

## Participation guidelines

Meetings with many participants, especially over video, can easily get hard to
follow or run off course. When we talk about issues we care about, it's easy to
get into heated debate. In order to respect everyone's time, and arrive to
worthwhile outcomes, this subcommittee follows the
["Participation guidelines" in the GraphQL Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/README.md#participation-guidelines);
a summary of which is:

- Participate
- Don't talk too much
- Volunteer to take notes
- Have an outcome in mind
- Contribute
- Choose your battles
- Champion alternatives
- Block progress as a last resort
- Be patient and persistent
