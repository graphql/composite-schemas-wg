## Attendee introductions and motives (30m, Benjie)

- Benjie: Graphile
  - Organized this
  - Benefits of GraphQL was the share spec, enable development of shared tooling
  - More and more introduction of composite solution, wants to see
    straightforward for people to build schemas and tooling that are compatible
    with different approaches
- Dotan
  - Representing the Guild
- Saihajpreet
  - Work on GraphQL js, schema stitching
- Yaacov
  - Got into GraphQL mainly through schema stitching
  - Still difficult to use GraphQL to access GraphQL sources, excited to
    collaborate on this problem.
- Tim
  - Stellate
  - New to topic, learning what we come up with
- Matteo
  - Focusing on open source
  - Represent author of library : apollo federation protocol; share what they
    learn
  - Collaborate on spec that is shared/generic
- Nathan
  - Working for startup in Austin
  - Tried different solutions in 2017/2018
  - Used GraphQL Modules
  - Also did exploration into Apollo Federation
- StefanoAW
  - Works for American Express
  - Interested because they do a lot of GraphQL
  - Using standard GraphQL tool for schema stitching
  - Can be a great opportunity, looking for good best practices
- Nicholas
  - Representing Amazon & AppSync
  - Looking that we can come up with a standard
  - Got a lot of requests how they can create composite schemas
- Predrag
  - Graphql compiler and trustfall
  - Probably use GraphQL differently than many others
    ([more info](https://www.hytradboi.com/2022/how-to-query-almost-everything))
    => use it to query in database style ; more like SQL, not to drive relay or
    react;
  - But benefit from tools in GraphQL ecosystem
  - Want to learn how to do federation better and learn from what everyone else
    has figured out
- Derek
  - Apollo
  - How all specifications work together
- Caleb
  - Representing Meta
  - Did a push on unifying schema stitching
  - Looking for what other strategies are out there
- Stephen
  - Netflix
  - Need to stitch/federate, doing their own thing, but Apollo filled in missing
    pieces, but wants to move these concepts into GraphQL spec
- Roman
  - Microsoft
  - Previous experience with complexity of schema (big), 5000 tables, etc, SAP
    45000 tables;
  - Things GraphQL won’t work at scale with number or entities;
  - Interested to see how we can advance GraphQL and make it scalable
- Bobbie
  - StepZen
  - We support Federation of graphs, important for this approach / approaches to
    be standardized.
- Jason
  - Intuit
  - Use Apollo Federation, there are many different ways you can use it
  - Having something a bit more standardized
- John
  - IBM Cloud K8S
  - APIs are evolving with different services and looking to adopt a Relay-style
    GraphQL federation to create a mesh
  - Separately interested in the problem to make GraphQL better for everyone
- Ivan
  - Apollo
  - Shared metadata for introspection, other schema concerns
- Martijn
  - Apollo
  - Part of team that designed apollo federation;
  - Intereste to hear more about problems people are encourtiner and approaches
    they have taken
  - Hoping common concerns to address in graphql spqc (documenlevel directives,
    exposing metadata);
  - Maybe concerns not in core graphql spec, we can write separate specs around,
    lots of oppty to discuss what we are trying to do and what is common about
    approaches we are taking
- Hugh
  - Apollo
  - GraphQL spec is teh best thing about GraphQl , coming together to
    standardize and put forward in specification, important to health of
    community
- Jens
  - WunderGraph
  - Founder of WunderGraph
  - Thanks Benjie for organizing this
  - Introspect services (not just graphql) and try to stitch together so as
    developer you can talk to any system in your organization or beyond
  - Issue early on: combine multiple schemas you run into naming collisions, 2
    schemas have the same types (i.e. user)
  - Introduced api namespacing (prefixing); hoping that discussions lead to
    proper solution that is better than prefixing stuff;
  - Not to come up with spec, but extend existing spec so you can compose
    schemas easily ; and then can leverage/ extended language for merging.
  - E.g. schema.org -> If there's a User, another company could understand what
    user that is
  - Hopes we find better ways to stitch
- Dustin
  - WunderGraph
  - Looking forward to have a spec that is OSS and free to use for everyone
- Jonny
  - Unity
  - Open telemetry, collaborating and sharing ideas to converge on nice way of
    doing things that we all agree on,
  - Provide experience from using it;
- Laurin
  - The Guild
  - Schema Registry, support different kinds of SDL-based schema merging
  - Did some research on that, realized that existing solutions are limited
    - No Redundancy (shared ownership) in merged types
    - No Field redundancy in merged schemas
  - A gateway could decide how to resolve those fields
- Uri
  - From guild
  - Excited that this is happening
  - Working with most of the concepts daily
  - Having clear wording would help tremendously
  - Having a clear definition what problems are being solved
  - Having defined the landscape
  - Excited to share everything they're doing

## Review agenda (2m, Benjie)

- SGMSF: Summary of Goals Mentioned So Far:
  - Desire for consistency
  - Concerns for too many ways to do it
  - Desire for open governance
  - Management of metadata
  - Naming collisions
- Shared definitions (types)
- Let's figure out more about the common concerns

## Find and discuss common concerns (up to 80m, Benjie)

- Dotan
  - If we start with terminology, featuers, ideas and concepts
  - Makes it easier to create more topics and things to discuss on
  - Helps to clarify what we're actually trying to do here
- Benjie: Could the different project leaders give a background on terminology
- Roman: (scenario)
  - Look at some really troubled scenarios today
  - Look at the group of developers / clients affected
  - For example if you try to use the GitHub API - it's 500k lines of code of
    schema
  - It's really hard / inhumane to make something out of this mess
  - For the client, it's important that the schema is not stitches together but
    can be downloaded in pieces
  - Downloading the GraphiQL introspection can be >300mb, maybe it could be
    looked at in smaller pieces
  - Important scenario to keep in mind
    - We don't always want to mix the schema into one big schema
    - Learn about scenarios where schema is in multiple pieces
  - 2nd scenario on server side
    - Big schema with multiple teams
    - Work independently, no contention on a central schema file, having a
      system that is stitching things together into one API
    - Not single frontend server stitching multipel graphql servers together
    - Allowing a schema living in multiple files
  - 3rd scenario: apollo federation
    - Multiple graphql servers, merge together to look like 1. Original schemas
      are lost for the front end user
  - Elephant in room:
    - Mutations only appear at top level; mutation type then has to merge
      mutations from subschemas, this is challenging.
  - Namespacing “hangs” everything.
  - Predrag Gruevski [chat]: I'm especially interested in being able to say that
    type X from schema A implements interface Y from schema B
  - John Starich [chat]: As a GraphQL user, it is very useful to me to have a
    single unified schema definition. The modules idea is interesting. I'd hope
    it remains easy to understand from the user's point of view.
  - Predrag Gruevski [chat]: I'd love to make it so that all the major benefits
    of the unified schema definition stick around, but I don't have to suffer
    the consequences of a schema with 300k types :)
- Predrag
  - Let's try to figure out what works out for the reads side first
  - Then look into the live query, mutation side etc
- Uri
  - Landscape: Core components
    - Schemas: we have schemas (not calling them servers for a reason), but
      executable schemas being created separately. GraphQL schemas, no matter
      how created
    - Merge Instructions: Extra definition of how do we turn those into 1 single
      schema; sometimes these definitions/ configurations and combine them
      together express in may different ways. Directives, metadata on servers,
      code on gateway, config on the gateway, / written anywhere else.
      - These may have different use-cases that would point to different ways of
        doing this.
  - Not saying servers: we have separation as to when we do the process, are the
    schemas part of a runtime server that we have no control over or are we
    doing unification at build time. We can come up with scenarios of how to
    merge, / conflicts between types/ conflicts between fields, and then
    separately how we solve them.
  - John in chat: In addition to Uri's point about merging, I think we should
    also consider composing schemas between gateways. In other words, composing
    at multiple levels.
- Roman
  - Additional instruction on merging ? can be
  - Uri: does not want to start with a specific technical way of specifying it.
    Wants to start with a technical scenario. 2 schemas, how we want unified
    schema to look like, what primitives do we need to express to create unified
    schema. Does not want to say up front to say it’s done through directives/
    import statements, etc. If we come up with “how” primitives, we could
    express all of these with everything, we can express the same thing with
    many different solutions. Can be flexible with expressing on the server
    itself or on things that merge together.
  - Add
- Yaacov
  - Suggestion how to tackle things first => Look at some the low-level building
    blocks
  - End goal = merging in runtime of schemas that you don't even control ->
    That's the
  - To get there, we could benefit from a way to talk about a group of types /
    directives together, (1) make sure that they internally validate, and (2)
    make sure those groups are composable.
  - Different ways of composing: some might be build-time, some run-time, but
    they all would work with a list of rules,
  - That could be quite useful to have in the spec, in terms of language
  - If we have a common set of rules/tools, we can compose more easily across
    organizations.
  - Not sure what to call these smaller groups: schema subsets, schema parts
- Predrag
  - Big fan of composability
  - Identify which ways can get into the way of composability
  - For example which schemas have dependencies
  - What things we might want to introduce to make it possible to compose + what
    things we explicitly don’t want to introduce because they will make
    composition harder
- Yaacov
  - Transformation: There are many ways how to merge things together
  - Different enums, scalars, fields with different arguments, there are a lot
    of different problems
  - Another helpful building block might be to transform existing schemas? Some
    things can be solved with namespacing or other transforms, other problems
    with composability that cannot be solved with namespacing or other
    transforms.
- Jens
  - There's a new directive for scalars, like specifiedBy
  - Would be interesting to have that for interfaces
  - Imagine you have an interface that says how a server should behave
  - If you have an interface, someone could now introspect from outside and
    check out on a URL what is behind it
  - You could have a geocoder interface, 3 service providers could implement the
    same interface
  - Now users can understand the concept
  - 2nd:
    - One big fear with composing - did anyone reach any limits if you have
      multiple hundreds of thousands of lines
    - Will we compose too much at some point?
- Predrag
  - Blew up the stack in Python, Rust etc
  - 700mb schema also doesn't work in GraphiQL right now
- Ivan
  - Question: In your case with a huge schema, do you think it's an
    introspection specific issue? Or is it more about SDL files?
- Predrag
  - Our return type isn't nested, but iterator of flattened results
  - Results can be rather large, schemas can be rather large
  - It's based on an introspected + federated databases and non-database data
    sources
  - Broader expectation from the ecosystem: That you can fully fit a schema or a
    query result in memory at the same time
  - Schemas are not fitting into the browser all at once
  - There's a lot of pagination, lazy loading
  - Fetch the first 100 things, add pagination
- Stephen
  - Interesting to hear different use-cases
  - In some cases you want to build one big schema, but build it in parts
  - Case 2: want to bring together subgraphs that are not aware of each other,
    at time they were made they did not know they would be brought into the
    composite graph.
  - Cataloging use-case, the reasons we want to composite.
- Jens
  - Interesting, as we started earlier with common language
  - If services know each other and you know the people behind the services, I
    call it federation
  - If it's from another service, I call it stitching
  - Maybe we just figure out a common terminology to name those concepts
- Yaacov
  - I only say stitching for the schema stitching in GraphQL Tools
    ([JavaScript library maintained by The Guild](https://www.graphql-tools.com/docs/schema-stitching/stitch-combining-schemas))
    -> Form of runtime composition, of which there are many types, including
    just for example Federation/HotChocolate
- Laurin
  - When I hear the term Federation for me it is instantly associated with
    Apollo Federation and the Apollo Platform
  - I think Apollo Federation is one of many “SDL-directive-based” schema
    composition methods
- Yaacov
  - 2 types of runtime composition
  - Federation is passing around entities through dynamically built scalars that
    accept anything
  - That’s another type of runtime composition
- Martijn
  - For Federation, the entity model is core, how it’s implemented might be a
    detail
  - There are alternatives to that, but the notion of federating the schema at
    entity boundaries is a pretty central concept to that
- Stephen
  - Runtime vs build time
  - Apollo Federation as a build time composition
  - You build out all the entities at build time, composition happens based on
    your schema ahead of time
  - We can also execute it on the same server, same box
- Yaacov
  - Could also be on different server
  - Maybe remote schema execution?
  - Trying to get at a difference
- Roman
  - There are problems with big schemas and introspection
  - This is the most visible part of the problem
  - GraphQL concerns the protocol needs to be extended
  - Stitching on the server and runtime and so on
  - This is the hidden part from the client
  - What servers are doing there
  - This part doesn't have to be in the GraphQL Syntax
  - It's more about servers and vendors producing their own standard, some extra
    files to communicate and organize the whole thing, maybe a manifest for the
    server to be able to be stitches together
  - This information doesn't have to be embedded into GraphQL language
  - Could be a separate standard
  - Suggest to focus on the GraphQL spec related parts
  - Clients communicating with server and trying to discover the schema with
    introspection and not being overflown with GB's of information
  - This would much more connect to the GraphQL spec
  - The server side backend stuff not so much
  - Would be good if it could fit without more additions
  - Server side is free to have their own additions, their own standard
- Uri
  - Would argue other way around
  - What you're saying is, that you have a technical issue of introspection
  - That's sth we need to figure out
  - Maybe I'm wrong, but my reading of intros I think that people are more
    interested in how schemas are merged together
  - Shouldn't be sth that is related to SDL
  - Let's try to find out what we want to express, then we can find out how to
    express it
  - A lot of people here are interested in the primitives of taking separate
    schemas and turning them into one big schema that the consumer can look at
    as one schema
- Benjie
  - Agrees with interpretation
  - 2 problems discussed here:
    - Multiple schemas into one
    - Or if you have one large schema (e.g. Facebook) -> How to break it up to
      make it manageable. That's more a technical problem, e.g. not having
      enough memory. This problem is independent from this WG. One to many vs
      many to one
- Yaacov
  - We might be able to reuse the building blocks
- Roman
  - If you have logically separated sub schemas on the server,
- Benjie
  - What you expose as different sub pieces vs how to build the different sub
    pieces
  - You can take a User type in federation and add fields in another place
  - We should focus on the building part to not have have scope creep
  - One theme I heard is: Does the schema know that it's composed or it doesn't?
  - Maybe it's a completely remote schema
  - Example: Stripe doesn't have a GraphQL Schema. But I include their API in my
    API for billing.
  - GitHub API: If you build a notifications manager for GitHub, you might want
    to use those part from another schema
  - You might just want to import a sub part from that
  - What Uri talked about early on: There's all these ways to expressing what
    the field in this schema can be included. Code or config.
  - The different use-cases: Top level or rather bottom up. Do they need
    separate solutions?
  - Or could there be a single solution that covers all of them
- Predrag
  - If we can find a way to combine schemas together, where the schemas don't
    know about each other, it'll also cover the other use case
- Uri
  - Interesting question. Also part of the reason I think you shouldn't separate
    implementation from where it sits
  - Who decides and when?
  - We could agree on a way to specify those two things being merged and maybe
    at that point you can decide, there's a directive in the server or put it on
    the client
  - If I have access to the sources, I can do it at build time, if not, I can
    validate in a different way
  - Let's first have a list of rules, then we can put them into different places
  - Then we can use those in different scenarios
  - If we have access to the underlying services, we have a couple of options
  - You can use the directives or rename the field
- Predrag
  - At Kensho, the federation system did what Uri was saying.
  - Multiple databases expose as GraphQL schema
  - Metadata service knows how to compose the schemas together
  - Client runs a query against the combined schema
    - Metadata service slices up the query into component queries + merging
      instructions
    - Client then runs individual queries against the separate databases, and
      combines the partial results as instructed
    - Execution and merging are done without the metadata service being involved
      at all afterward
- Uri
  - That's why I wanted to separate this. Not to use Gateway, Client
  - But maybe terminology like “the merged schema” and “consumer”
  - Consumer could be a client. Could be a function calling another function
  - We see all kinds of use-cases in GraphQL
- Yaacov
  - That sounds like what Benjie said, that we should talk about generic
    solutions, independent of if the schemas know of each other
- Dotan
  - How do you even define the different merging possibilities?
  - If you can merge any GraphQL schema without them having to support specific
    metadata, this might even be a more flexible solution
- Yaacov
  - Agreed
  - Another use-case we encountered in schema stitching: It gets pretty
    confusing to relay remote errors back to users
  - Do we want to give the user knowledge about the remote schema here? Do we
    need to transform the error? Sometimes we want to do that
  - There could be some improvements we could make to the GraphQL error spec.
  - I'd also encourage the implementors to return errors that follow the spec as
    much as possible, as they give problems while stitching
- Ivan
  - Question: You need to transform errors anyway, I'm not sure I understand
    what the problem is?
- Yaacov
  - Sometimes we get errors from remote schemas, where the implementors at
    Gateway or GraphQL implementation don't add the path
  - You can't be sure if a null on a certain field resolves
  - Generally helpful to return the suggested fields in errors
  - Improvements on the error bundling
  - There was a bundling / chaining error proposal at the WG
  - Errors in particular could be fleshed out a bit more in the spec
  - This WG coudl think of improvements on the main GraphQL spec that are not
    100% related
- Martijn
  - Agreed.
  - Standardazing error types, how they're used would be useful to everyone
- Predrag
  - Every time you have multiple schemas combined, it could happen that any view
    on any schema has changed.
  - What happens, if a non-nullable field is now nullable?
  - Who's in the wrong here?
    - From the consumer’s perspective, it was given a non-nullable field in the
      schema, it ran a valid query, and got a bad result
    - From the underlying service’s perspective, its schema has changed and it
      returned a valid result per that schema.
  - I don't think there's a clear answer here, worth thinking about some more
- Benjie
  - The final schema, the composite schema should be a GraphQL schema
  - It must be certain, that the underlying services do not break its rules
  - Otherwise it's not GraphQL compliant
  - Using the term sub graph, which I tried to avoid ;)
  - We talked about a composite schema, merged schema, ...
  - What does everyone call the sub schemas at the moment?
- Dotan
  - Sub schemas are fine
- Martijn, Hugh
  - Subgraph
- Benjie
  - Do you feel ownership over that term?
- Martijn
- Benjie
  - Anyone unhappy with sub schema?
    - No
  - Uri was careful with the term server
  - The GraphQL spec does not use the term server, but the term service
  - A service doesn't even need to be a server
  - For example Relay provides features within your client
  - Do we need a term for that? And do we need a term for the service that runs
    the composite schema?
  - Is there a nicer way to express it?
- Predrag
  - Slight reservation with the “service that runs the composite schema.”
  - At Kensho, the schema runs from the consumer of the schema, that might be
    the browser.
- Ivan
  - Question: Should it be a finalized executable schema or just a set of types
    that don't validate as a full schema?
- Benjie
  - Great question.
  - Subschema should be a fully executable schema
- Laurin
  - Let's say you have different sub schemas. You have one service that only
    cares about subscriptions - that service wouldn't comply to the spec.
  - Some people add a dummy Query type then
  - For me sub schema means a schema that is executable on its own
- Yaacov
  - Schema composition at build time can be composing non valid schemas
  - Holy grail of schemas that don't know of each other would be valid
  - Tough to think about solving this problem by only focussing on remote
    schemas
  - Might want to think about solving one at a time, go different tracks
  - Problem for nomenclature
- Predrag
  - Question: If you had non-complete schemas, does it introduce an issue with a
    Query type that is a noop. Composing those seems to create the same noop
    Query type. Is there an issue there?
  -
- Laurin
  - Schemas use query root fields to merge together all the different parts
  - Mutations/Subscriptions are easily mergable
  - To merge entities, we need entry points
- Predrag
  - I would assume that some of the schemas has entry points
- Stephen
  - With federation you have that entry point. But it's an implementation detail
  - It's not necessarily part of that subgraph
  - It could change, is rather part of the execution contract.
  - Consumers never see it
  - It's valid to have a sub schema that is just defining an entity or a type
- Uri
  - Would agree of starting with the sentiment around solving merging,
    composition of valid schemas
  - Wouldn't necessarily lock it out from the other solutions
  - Maybe later on we could also tackle that
  - In terms of naming I wouldn't say it only needs a valid schema, because
    maybe we would want to tackle that
- Bobbie
  - It would be important to know the difference.
  - Having a clear term for one schema that is valid, one that is not would be
    beneficial.
  - There are many different use cases.
  - In the case that the sub schema doesn't know that it's being merged, it's a
    pretty valid use-case
  - There's also the use-case of a schema that doesn't know that it's being
    merged
  - If the subschema knows that it's consumed, it could be more performant if it
    would have some meta data
  - We also talked about where the sub schema changed and the composite schema
  - There's a contract that comes to my mind
  - You know where you are consumed
  - More like a "I changed and want to put a notification out"
- Jens
  - We compose different schemas and try to do that automatically
  - One user was using Graphile with Relay spec
  - It was implementing the Node interface
  - What if one schema implements the Node interface, one not?
  - That could break the schemas
- Benjie
  - The idea that you have shared interfaces is an important concept in
    composition
  - Uri mentioned we need rules, I'm very curious what those rules could be
  - One rule is, add this field to this type, but there could be more complex
    ones
  - The fact they're called the same doesn't mean they're the same
  - Stating that they're the same could be beneficial
- Predrag
  - This is one of the reasons why I'm a fan to have the rules as much as
    possible defined outside of the schemas that are being merged.
  - If the rules are outside, you know what you're targeting. Can generate the
    Relay compatible or the incompatible solution as appropriate.
  - It's impossible to know how people will use that in the first place.
  - It would be sad if GitHub forced me to use a schema in a certain way.
- Benjie
  - We do have the problem of schemas knowing that they're stitched together,
    some not
  - There's a difference between data and code
  - Do we need any code for this or is data alone sufficient for these
    use-cases?
  - Any further topics to raise?
- Hugh
  - Is there a way to enable discussion on the composite schemas repo? [enabled
    right after this]
  - A lot of the stuff we talked about could have discussions on GitHub
- Predrag
  - There might be interest in a social hour to get to know each other, just
    putting this out here. If there's interest, we can put something together.
- Benjie
  - Otherwise, there have been a few things in text not reflected in voice
  - Someone shared that they have a distributed GraphQL glossary document
- Laurin
  - I started this when we started research about the different options out
    there
  - With that you have one document that you can look at and see what it means
  - The idea is that you can see which solutions work together and which won't
- Jonny
  - One question about the document: Where did you start, what were your aims in
    building that out?
- Laurin
  - Started in understanding what solutions are available and how they work
  - Most popular is schema stitching from GraphQL Tools
  - The other is Apollo Federation
  - Not too aware of other languages
  - Even internally when talking about schema stitching and federation, we made
    sure that we're talking about the same things.
  - Right now it's a Notion document, open to convert it into Markdown which we
    can move to GitHub, so everyone can contribute to it
- Benjie
  - Let's figure out, which things we want to talk about async
  - Made a start on this
    - Definitions
    - Rules approach, what are the different rules that the schema metadata
      needs to work with
    - Roman talked about modularization of large schemas that can't be
      represented in memory. Not a topic for this WG. However, many people at
      this WG are affected, so we could talk about this in a discussion in the
      main GraphQL WG.
  - What other discussions should we have?
    - Bobbie: Documenting use cases
    - Ivan: Scalability issues
      - Name conflicts, namespacing
      - Size of resulting schema
    - Benjie:
      - A lot of people who didn't make it here today mentioned, that
        namespacing could be could for the composite working group
      - It might also tie into the modularity that Roman mentioned
    - Hugh:
      - Will this meeting be the place to carry the conversation for meta data
        over introspection, introspection over sdl?
    - Benjie:
      - No, those are not part of this sub group. This sub group will benefit
        from it, but if it's in schema or outer schema is separate. That's more
        for the main WG atm.
      - There's overlap there
    - Ivan [chat]

    - Ivan
      - There'll also be a call about custom metadata and what we should use
        there
      - About previous points:
        - Discussion was, do people have hit different limitations. I'd be
          interested in hearing about that.
    - Predrag
      - 2ct: They'll be related. Type check can run into scalability issues on
        large schemas, even if query and result are small. Interested in having
        it be a singular discussion.
    - Ivan
      - Probably right, good to have that as a central discussion
    - Jens
      - Question about errors:
        - If errors happen in the sub schema?
        - What errors and paths should you return to the client?
        - Shouldn't the client at the composite schema?
        - The sub schema and composed schema path could be very different
    - Ivan
      - Spec answers the question: Where it happens
    - Roman
      - What do composed schemas have to do with errors in the query, not in the
        type system?
      - If you have a query with nested fields and one of the fields blows up,
        it doesn't have anything to do with the Type system, schema or how it
        was composed
    - Ivan
      - When you send one big query and you need to distribute it to sub schemas
      - Then you compose the result
      - Can keep it async
    - Benjie
      - Yaacov, Predrag you both talked about composability.
      - Making sure rules are not broken etc.
      - Who'd create an issue there?
        - Will work together
        - https://github.com/graphql/composite-schemas-wg/discussions/35
      - Who wants to create a discussion around errors?
      - Anything else?
- Terminology using currently:
  - Federation:
    - schemas know each other
    - Is this just Apollo federation?, sdl directive schema composition
  - Stitching:
    - (jens)schemas don’t know each other
    - Schemas stitching package from GraphqL tools, form of runtime composition.
      E.g. federation/hot chocolate.
  - From Laurin: BTW we tried to come up a composite/distributed GraphQL

  - Subschema
    - When composing schemas together, one of the components being composed
    - Not necessarily a fully-valid schema that can stand on its own (but we may
      consider only fully-valid schemas to start)
- Use-cases Summarised (TBD)
  - Tracking the 1 and making it into many
  - Working with big schemas
    - This is a problem that needs solving but independent of aims of this
      working group.
  - Tracking the many and making it into 1:
    - This is this working group.
    - E.g Different groups constructing the schemas
  - These are inter-related, and tools created for one might help the
    other…(Benjie) suggests that we separate, because they are different
- Do you co
