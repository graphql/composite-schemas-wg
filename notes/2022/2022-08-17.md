## Next steps for [subschema composability rules](https://github.com/graphql/composite-schemas-wg/pull/37) (15m, Uri)

- Uri:
  - Not a lot to add on top of what Jacob had to say
  - Very interesting
  - Hope to take the conversation to what would be the next steps
- Yaacov
  - Would love to hear people’s feedback
  - Thoughts already expressed in PR
  - There may be errors since it’s a first draft
  - The people weigh in, the better
  - Kept it broad
    - Execution as a single vs execution to the subschemas that were the objects
      of the composition
    - Single-service model being much more flexible
  - Thoughts for next steps
    - Work on some code to validate
    - (Cut out, need to re-listen to get notes here)
- ## Benjie
- Yaacov
  - Federation is more strict rather than at the current time
  - Don’t think it’s a good idea to be lax on things like enums
  - Merging on some other gateways is only on object types which is more strict
  - Define an upper bound for what breaks composability
  - Then add layers which contain warnings
- Matteo:
  - The way namespacing and transformations happen seems quite heavy
  - Something that’s missing is the concept of a namespace/modules
  - Maybe possible to add this concept? Instead of renaming
- John:
  - No namespacing allows us to present a unified schema
  - Nice to have it all in one simple flow
- Julian
  - Maybe can treat namespacing as an internal thing
- Paolo
  - Maybe treat namespacing to treat at build time rather than run-time
- Laurin:
  - Might be no need to namespacing types
  - But rather, merge/compose them
- John:
  - Maybe it is good to opt-in
  - If designing a schema that is intended to be composed does this define
    meanings of types
- Laurin:
  - Needs to be some metadata
  - Identifying use-cases where they can be merged
- Paolo:
  - When you are talking about metadata are you talking type name
  - Will it use introspection?
- Derek:
  - Outside of this working group, but there is some work to get this
    information
  - Not yet available but there is an active proposal
  - Opened a couple of weeks ago
- Paolo
  - People should be able to reach out and say give me the data
  - Should not rely on introspection
    - Query might be never ending
- Pendrag
  - I’ve had that problem and share concern
- Derek
  - Slow introspection query issue is when using for run-time composition
  - Not an issue for build-time composition
- Predrag
  - Can be forced to evaluate introspection at run-time
- Paolo
  - Should we have rules for namespacing?
  - Or not?
- Yaacov
  - Important to maintain the ability to compose schema that you do not manage
  - Might want to hide the fact that that data is remote
  - Create a unified APi from remote that don’t control
- Paolo
  - Composition engine can be combined in many ways which might not have the
    same rules
  - Something must compose the schema
- John
  - Maybe a dividing line between schema ownership
- Derek
  - Maybe things need to be renamed if defining the same type
- Paolo
  - This goes against composing a schema you don’t control
- Yaacov
  - May be talking about different things
  - Composing sub-schemas don’t control
    - May need transformations
    - And namespacing is a technique
  - Interested in subschemas that don’t control and merging these is important
  - Namespacing is a type of transformation that is helpful for composing
    subschemas
  - Don’t have to be defined by subschema itself
- Paolo
  - Case when don’t control is the most complex
  - If we solve this, others are then solved as well
- Laurin
  - What’s a use-case?
- Matteo
  - Exposing a single graph with no namespace info is more user friendly
  - Masks the complexity of doing this merging
  - If 2 graphs with 2 teams, they need to coordinate a lot in reality
  - Can see the fact that in certain companies that expose some concept of
    namespacing they are exposed in a way that is clear where it came from
  - Namespacing could avoid a lot of conflicts and have things work out of the
    box in a lot of cases
  - Concern is that at the moment, there are a lot of things that can go wrong
    and not simple to maintain
- Joey
  - Another use-case that is related
  - Sometimes you do want merge that that you have control over but don’t want
    to control
  - E.g. Let people onboard there own namespace and watch for commonalities
  - Do want to merge things that we technically control but don’t actually want
    to control
- Paolo
  - Assume schema is split
  - Let’s have a User service and Book service
  - Should not expect that the user service can talk to the book service
- Predrag
  - Can happen in the real world where services talk to each other
  - Metadata service that gives execution plan
  - Then all done client side
  - Composition logic is housed in a service but execution is client side
  - Helpful to not assume that the schema operations have to be done by service
  - Metadata for how the composition happens should be able to execute on both
    client and server
- Paolo
  - This is amazing
  - There is also a synchronization problem? Or maybe not?
  - Could produce a concurrency problem that could go bad?
- Predrag
  - It makes concurrency problems more obvious
- Paolo
  - I see your point
- Yaacov
  - Not aware of existing composition that works like that
  - Seems like a more mesh-like approach
  - Might run into looping problems
  - Another thing that your question touches on is, is the subschema a composed
    schema
- Paolo
  - I see that a subschema can be composite
- Benjie
  - This is a really interesting discussion
  - Sometimes compose schemas that do or don’t control
  - One of things we come back to is there description of data and metadata
  - Open work on managing this
  - Can’t put metadata into a remote schema that don’t control
  - Will say the topic of explicit namespaces has been proposed a few times at
    the working group
    - Not made much progress
    - Bar for adding it quite high
    - Reason: GraphLQ focussed on schema that is designed to be consumed
    - Shouldn’t necessarily be exposing these complexities
  - Another thing is automatically renaming things
    - One thing that comes out is an explosion of types
    - Better to have explicit rules for these
  - Would like to continue discussion but let’s move onto glossary and circle
    back at the end

## Next steps for the glossary (10m, Laurin)

- Agenda:
  - splitting it into glossary + appendix for branded terms and appendix for
    actual implementations
  - call for feedback and reviews
- Laurin
  - Last WG we all agreed terminology is currently very vague
  - Idea is to create glossary and unified terms that everyone can use
  - Created a PR based on an internal doc
  - Right now, a collection of terms describing stuff
  - Also contains branded terms such as apollo federation
  - Want to ask for feedback and add missing stuff
  - Next step is to divide it a bit
    - Branded terms sep. doc?
    - Appendix?
    - Open Source/Hosted solutions
    - Etc
  - Maybe pick the correct solutions from the provided ones
- Benjie
  - Excellent work Laurin
  - Great to have shared vocab
  - As you point out, separating the branded would be beneficial
  - More generic terms could be use in whatever form of spec we decide to build
  - E.g. Came up with subschema last month
  - What do you think the next step is?
- Laurin
  - Yes, feedback
  - And then for me, the next step is to split it into bits
  - And figure where we want to put this stuff
  - MAybe someone has a good idea
- Benjie
  - Propose to split into 2 files as discussed and use the RFCs folder
  - Advantage of having it merged is people can send PRs to it and iterate
    quicker that way
  - RFCs folder has a low bar top getting things merged to it
    - Could use an alternative folder (e.g. docs)
    - But might add additional weighting which it is not ready for
  - RFCs is good bc not official
  - Wdyt
- LAurin
  - Sounds good
- Benjie
  - Would you like to take as an action item?
- LAurin
  - Sounds good
- Predrag
  - What about an anti-glossary?
- Benjie
  - Brilliant idea
  - Yaacov did the same and would be very beneficial
- Predrag
  - More technical q for laurin and benjie
  - Most things are open source in the glossary, what about non-open source
    contributions that you can’t reference explicitly
- Benjie
  - Would like to gather use-cases
  - Such as existing solution (apollo fed, schema stitching)
  - A doc on each of these would be beneficial
  - Can find commonalities and standard metadata
  - Where should we put it? Another folder like RFCs folder with README
  - Would you like that action item Predrag?
- Predrag
  - Yeah definitely
  - Happy to add another entry to reference blog posts etc within the existing
    document
  - Whatever you prefer
- Benjie
  - Any other thoughts?
- John
  - Makes sense
- Joey
  - We use the term namespacing a lot but doesn’t always mean the same thing
  - Maybe we address this?
- Predrag
  - Approach in rust, if lack of consensus, use an explicit term that is not
    standardised
- John
  - Sounds like there was also prefixing and metadata driven one as well
- Benjie

  - 3 docs:

    - One is glossary of generic terms
    - One which is a list of vendor terms
      - People can add their own things etc
      - Reference projects
    - Terms to avoid

    * Glossary.md (generic terms)

  * VendorSolutions.md (the solutions that are out there)

  * TermsToAvoid.md (branded/misleading/ambiguous terms)

  - Want to talk about concept of data
  - Is everything we need to do, doable from metadata or do we sometimes need
    code as well?
  - Is there a need for code or will metadata suffice?

- Paolo - I missed this, Paolo could you provide your answer if possible please?
  Thank you!
- Predrag
  - Should be doable just as data and not require code
- Benjie
  - Think we’re done on glossary topic, let’s go to previous topic
  - Want to capture action items, is there anything else?
- Matteo
  - Want to talk about previous subject
  - If I understand correctly, what Yaacov is doing is finding the most tools
    that we can agree on to compose schema
  - Then we can think separately if it’s composable or not
  - I like what Yaacov has done in identifying what does it mean to compose a
    schema
  - Create an action item to create something like a test suite
    - What is legal
    - What is not legal
  - People can confirm if they agree with it
  - Can then come up with all sorts of use-cases for this
- Benjie
  - It would be valuable to find out why rules don’t match
- Paolo
  - To clarify, is this something that would eventually become a test suite
- Matteo
  - Yes
- Uri
  - Other people can look at this and confirm that this makes
- Benjie
  - Definitely an action time for everyone to look at Yaakov's proposal
- Yaacov
  - Do people want me to work on a code implementation?
  - Some kind of reference implementation that exists or shouldn't
- Predrag
  - Test cases should live in RFC
  - As for implementation, no strong feelings other than what language
- Yaacov
  - I was thinking In JavaScript
- John
  - I agree
  - Given a, b, c and does it compose d
- Benjie
  - We need to be aware of not limiting innovation
  - And make sure it’s not the only way of doing x
  - We want to identify what are the common cases and write those down
- Paolo
  - I completely agree
- Predrag
  - I saw it as if you have these subschema they are composable in x situation
    and not in y situation
- John
  - Maybe test suite is not the right name, rules suite perhaps?
- Predrag
  - I had a similar idea
- Paolo
  - How we reach that point we shouldn’t care how the client should implement
- Jason
  - Different mechanisms for different vendors - how do we think about unifying
    this
  - There are different tradeoffs in each
  - Some have conventions, some don’t
  - And there are a breadth of solutions
  - There is a little more than merging the schemas
- Paolo
  - The GraphQL spec doesn’t define metadata, right?
  - Or am I wrong on this?
- Jason
  - There are directives that are used/interpreted by infrastructure
  - This extra metadata is interpreted
  - Most vendor capture how do we merge x and y through this
  - But there is a range of solutions out there
- Benjie
  - Identity is a problem that been out there for a while
  - You are correct that many solutions have to solve in one way or another
  - What I would like to see is a grid comparison of a shared topic
  - This would be valuable to see different approaches written down
  - We can make decisions based on this to find out if solutions follow similar
    patterns or not
  - Would love to see for each of these different topics:
    - Identifying what the schemas
    - How to retrieve things
  - We are not at the point of specifying how we act on this data
  - But the indication of the identity is very valuable
  - If someone can take on the work of comparing these solutions would be
    valuable
- Predrag
  - If we are open to unorthodox solutions
  - We have no type merging at Kenshu
  - It makes the composition logic simpler
  - E.g. User has a library of books in another service
  - Allow you define macros
    - Pretend that some edge exists that is actually composition of edges
  - Before execution, these get expanded
  - Every type has a clear owner/ID while the user writing this query gets to
    pretend the shape is something they control
- John
  - Clarifying q
    - Each type gets a specifiedby scalar saying where it comes from
- Predrag
  - For any type in the final composed schema you know explicitly where it came
    from
  - Any edge can either be within the schema or can be crossing a schema
    boundary and can be injected at composition time
  - Lend to client-centric execution
  - Execute components and then connect the data sets back together
- John
  - So you saying there is a UUID that they use
  - If they share they get composed at the same type
- Predrag - I missed a bit of this - can you fill out please? Thank you! _
  Example _ Slightly outdated code example repo from a meetup 3 years ago, but
  still demonstrates the overall idea: \
  [https://predr.ag/talks/#graphql-as-a-high-performance-cross-database-query-language](https://predr.ag/talks/#graphql-as-a-high-performance-cross-database-query-language)

          [https://github.com/obi1kenobi/graphql-compiler-cross-db-example](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/graphql-compiler-cross-db-example)

          * The system’s query syntax is a bit different than what you’re used to:  [https://github.com/obi1kenobi/graphql-compiler-cross-db-example/blob/master/01_intro_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/graphql-compiler-cross-db-example/blob/master/01_intro_demo.ipynb)
          * Schema reshaping + cross-datasource execution: [https://github.com/obi1kenobi/graphql-compiler-cross-db-example/blob/master/02_macro_edges.ipynb](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/graphql-compiler-cross-db-example/blob/master/02_macro_edges.ipynb)
          * In this case, the schema reshaping is through _macro edges,_ edges that are added for user convenience so the user doesn’t have to navigate the actual complexity of the underlying schema. What the user perceives as a macro edge can actually be hiding multiple edge traversals + predicates under the hood, which the query-writing user doesn’t care about.
          * We can define other kinds of macros as well:
              * macro fields: non-edge fields (scalars and their lists) whose values are defined as a transformation across other fields, potentially traversing edges. For example: a “booksOwnedCount: Int!” macro field on “User” can be a macro field expanding to “traverse the User.ownedBooks edge and count how many vertices are on the other side”.
              * macro types: akin to a view in SQL, a type that is defined as a composition of other types

- Jason
  - How do know which IDs to send
  - And which correspond to which metadata
- Predrag
  - Fetch one field and feed into filter onto the other side
- Jason
  - Who is responsible for owning this data
- Predrag
  - We are lucky with having a single database that contains the metadata on how
    data sources interconnect
- Benjie
  - Action item for Predrag to add example in the glossary for the Kensho
    example
  - Would like everyone to have a look at the PR for what schema composability
    is
    - If we don’t have agreement, figure out why we don’t have agreement
  - Look at existing solutions, find the standard pieces and specifying those
    bits
  - Do not want to limit innovation e.g Predrag’s solution
  - If there’s nothing else, would be good to call this meeting to a close
  - Next meeting on 8th september

## Action items

- Everyone
  - Everyone to have a look at the PR for what schema composability is
- Predrag
  - Predrag to add an example in the glossary/relevant doc for the Kensho
    example mentioned
  - A doc on each of existing solutions to find commonalities and standard
    metadata
    - To be put in another folder like RFCs folder with README
    - Or suitable alternative
- Yaacov
  - To look into defining a test or rules suite reference implementation for
    defining what is and what isn’t composable
- Laurin
  - To split existing document up into 3 parts:
    - Glossary.md (generic terms)
    - VendorSolutions.md (the solutions that are out there)
    - TermsToAvoid.md (branded/misleading/ambiguous terms)
