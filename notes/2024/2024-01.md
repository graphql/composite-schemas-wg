## Determine volunteers for note taking (1m, Host)

- Jeff
- Laurin

## Review previous meeting's action items (5m, Host)

- https://github.com/graphql/composite-schemas-wg/issues
- 1 year passed!
- Closed an everybody:review item; everything else remains

## Setup working process for spec work (20m, @michaelstaib and @martijnwalraven)

- Michael: Starts with history, a lot of discussions about composite schemas.
  The conclusion is that there is a need to have a common standard/terminology
  and progress and a composite schema spec. The goal is to set up a working
  group that meets weekly to move things forward. We already started a few
  meetings in a few weeks. \
  Things that we want to answer are “How to merge/compose schemas” and How to do
  execution across distributed graphql apis that are merged/composed. For now, the
  main-focus is mergin/. composing schemas
- Kamil: We want to align on rules for merging/composing schemas, and have
  common rules for subgraphs/schemas validation that can work for all kinds of
  implementations
- Michael: The expectation here is to not have something done in 3 months, but
  rather a year. There will be a lot of work and discussions happening.
- Martijn: we also need to decide what belongs to such a specification and what
  should not be part of the specification e.g. detailed execution formats (query
  plan), merging and validation rules, directive annotated SDL (supergraph).
- Uri: I agree that overspecifying might hurt innovation. But first, we should
  all share our knowledge and then looking at that decide how to answer what
  should be spec and what shouldn't.
- Michael: we don't need to commit to exclusion/inclusion right now, but to
  avoid binding vendors under the rules we can do what the spec does: strictly
  specify, but add clause: "ensure the observable result is the same, but do
  whatever you want"
- Michael: we currently have these meetings at 11am Central European time; if
  this doesn't work well for some people then now would be a good time to raise
  it
- Meetings are timeboxed to 1 hour, discuss a topic, agendas here, RFC folder
  here, videos will synchronize to YouTube.
- Jeff: monthly meetings are still a thing. How does one contribute the weekly
  meetings?
- Michael: smaller meetings for specific points, same as the general GraphQL
  working group
- Benjie: use the first Thursday for the primary meeting.
  - 1 meeting 4pm UTC every Thursday for 1 hour.
  - The first meeting of every month is the primary one that also summarizes the
    progress.
- General agreement on the proposed scheduled.
- Benjie: what is the difference between a local and a remote schema?
- Michael: at the start, it was only about merging types. This is more abstract.
  The community wants concrete specifications and steps how to build a gateway.
- Kamil: We are talking about 2 graphql schemas and how they can become one
- Michaell: We are not talking about transports, we talk about semantic
  merging/composing of Types in a distributed architecture.
- Michael: so far there is not that much too share from the subsequent meetings
- Kamil: should we also define focuses for the weekly meetings, so we all come
  in with the goal on working on that topic
- Benjie: That is a good idea. We should double down on the terms, that is why
  the glossary/appendix is important.
- Michael: We already started working on an appendix
- Jeff: Should already existing implementation specific things be within the
  specification
- Michael: both APollo Federation and GraphQL Fusion share the same concepts,
  share similarities but also are different on more vendor-specific solutions.
  E.g. Fusion does not reason about authentication. My goal is that we take all
  the ideas out there and from that form the best possible specification that
  combines the best concepts out of all existing solutions.
- Martijn: yeah it will be a subset of Apollo Federation and GraphQL Fusion
- John: it might make sense to pin the issue for the glossary, because it is
  important to figure out what we are talking about.
- Kamil: I can work on creating a list of all the atomic topics/proposals
  required for the specification. Then for each of those we can figure out
  whether we want to have this in the spec or not. E.g. validation per subgraph,
  composite schema (supergraph) etc.
- Michael: Martijn already started such a list.
- Martijn: yeah it is important to define all of that
- Pascal: it is really important to write it down, so we don’t forget about what
  words we use for what
- Everyone: agrees
- Benjie: I like about graphql spec that its lean and other things can be
  appendix and solved in userland.
- Michael: execution could be defined in generic way, but it is not necessary
- Benjie: anything else to discuss?
- Everyone: silence
- **ACTION** - Benjie: Setup the weekly meetings agendas
- Benjie: wrap it up
- Benjie: schedule meetings and update calendar
- **ACTION** - Benjie: Update the google calendar
