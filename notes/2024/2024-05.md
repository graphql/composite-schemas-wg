- Introduction of attendees (5m, Host)
  - Done, we’re all introduced
- Summary of previous meetings:
  - `@lookup` directive and path syntax are the main topics
  - `@lookup` is how we resolve entities and entity patches from downstream
    services/sources. We've learned by reflecting on what all the different
    solutions do for this. This is a key concept to be built into the spec.
  - Access modifiers (`@internal`, `@inaccessible`, `@private`, `@public`,
    `@external`). We currently have two: `@internal` and `@external`.
    `@external` helps the query planner. `@internal` is accessible from the
    gateway but not externally in the public schema.
  - Patch lookups suggest we might need more access modifiers to specify the
    nuances. Michael currently working on an RFC document exploring all these
    nuances.
  - `@is` and `@required` use the "path syntax". This is how two different type
    system members can be marked as semantically equivalent to each other, and
    also ties into `@lookup`. (Also `@provides`)
  - FieldSelection / FieldSelectionSet scalars.
  - Variable batching proof of concept is advancing, but a few more follow up
    tasks to go. Things to explore include Apollo's Multipart Subscription
    Formatter and the IBM cost control system.
  - Derek (chat):
    - Yeah we need same lookups to use same `@key`s across subgraphs
    - `fooFromA` / `fooFromB`? - Shane: Yes
  - Issue #34 - lookup with access modifiers: would we allow lookup in two
    different schemas with the exact same field/arguments/etc?
    - Do we want to make it clear which subgraph you're going to? Might solve
      some of the issues Pascal raised.
- Review of action items:
  - [all] Review/submit test cases - still relevant?
  - [MS] yes please keep open, Shane contributed some
- `@lookup`
  - What is it? 🤷
  - Stipulate 2 subgraphs: type A,
  -
  - Figuring out naming - `@patchers`? internal/private + `@lookup`
  - (Refer to video for full context - need multimedia to fully appreciate the
    nuance here. Declaring note-taking bankruptcy 😂)
  - Benjie (chat):
    - Some `@lookup` are "source of truth"
    - Some are just "extensions"
    - Derek: Yep some `@lookup`s are valid queries outside of “federation”
    - Others can only be invoked down in the query plan
    - Benjie: An alternative directive e.g. `person(id: ID!): Person @extension`
      might be better.
    - Derek: yep
  - `@patch` another potential name - again, just aligning on the concept
  - Benjie: (summarizes), semantics behind “extension” name
  - Exposing metadata to clients would be a key use case
  - Pascal: keep experimenting with concepts as well; not just naming, maybe
  - Shane: confirming, is lookup also something to take a look at?
  - Pascal: entity, type able to be resolved
  - Michael: not about ownership of a type, it’s about ownership of a key
  - I can tell you if Person exists if I give you a defined key here
  - Shane: entities shouldn’t be nullable, which is an issue - can solve w/ this
    syntax, get these questions from a reference resolver - can Router handle
    that?
  - Michael: lookups being explicitly nullable
  - Shane: yeah, that would resolve it - can choose and decide
  - Benjie: concern if you have multiple sources of truth - multiple lookups,
    each defining diff fields, one might not know the data has been deleted. XOR
    null. Which wins? Null?
  - Derek: that’s a principle of Federation, given an id, resolve same thing
    across. If not, data problem to be fixed (outside of Fed)
  - Michael: null would win - cannot guarantee non-nullability
  - Benjie: though I agree in principle RE: data consistency - talking about
    distributed systems
  - Michael: if you use eventual consistency - 2 subgraphs can resolve same
    entity, could be optimized in query planning, can tell implementors to
    optimize for certain things
  - Algorithms to steer towards subgraphs - down the line I would say
  - In general, this could be out-of-scope. Depends on user, what kind of
    microservice architecture they’re using
  - Benjie: Interesting discussion, move to next topic
- Path syntax:

  - Pascal: (shares screen)
  - `FieldSelection` scalar - expresses semantic equivalence
  - GraphQL isn’t designed for this - see field-selection.md
  - Benjie: dot syntax could conflict with the Schema Coordinates spec - `a.b`
    under the schema coordinates spec would mean the field `b` on the `a` type.
  - I wrote a spec 3 years ago that extended the Schema Coordinates spec for
    this; effectively a shorthand for operations where `>` means selection set
    and `Foo.x` would mean an inline fragment on type `Foo` containing the
    selection `x` (e.g. `... on Foo { x }`). This allows the same traversal as
    you're doing without conflicting with schema coordinates; e.g.
    `film>Movie.movieTitle` would be equivalent to
    `{ film { … on Movie { movieTitle } } }` which you're currently expressing
    as `film&lt;Movie>.movieTitle`.

  - Michael: we do need `@oneOf`
  - Schema should not point to arguments - lot of constraints around that
  - Benjie: valid, only uses these forms of operation expressions
  - Benjie (chat): `@oneOf` is also important for `@lookup`; e.g.
  - ```graphql
    input UserFinder @oneOf {
      id: ID
      username: String
    }

    type Query {
      user(by: UserFinder!): User @lookup
    }
    ```

  - Michael:
    ```graphql
    input UserFinder @oneOf {
      id: ID
      username: String
    }
    type Query {
      user(
        by: UserFinder!
          @is(field: "id", on: "id")
          @is(field: "username", on: "username")
      ): User @lookup
    }
    ```
