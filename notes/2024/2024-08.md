- Determine volunteers for note taking (1m, Host)
- Review agenda (2m, Host)
- Review prior secondary meetings (5m, Host)
  - (Michael screensharing)
  - `@lookup` directive being presented
  - “A way to resolve an entity by a stable key”
  - The core of the composite schemas spec
  - `@lookup @internal` - a technical way to resolve an entity
  - `@is` with a selection mapping to declare how an object maps itself
  - `@require` with a selection mapping to declare which data needs to be
    resolved from other source schemas
  - `@shareable` allows multiple object types to resolve to an entity
  - Acknowledging the correlation between size of spec and ability to move it
    forward
- Review previous meeting's action items (5m, Host)
  - Ready for review
  - All open action items (by last update)
- Review Previous Progress (5m, Host)
- Continue Discussion Discussion 277 on combining arbitrary schema (20m, David)
  - [https://github.com/graphql/composite-schemas-wg/discussions/277#](https://github.com/graphql/composite-schemas-wg/discussions/277#)
  - (David presenting)
  - Current wording doesn’t specify combining arbitrary schema, which makes
    sense
  - Trying to understand prior art
  - Describes how to compose subgraphs (aka source schema)
  - Acknowledges Martijn’s note about metadata overlay
  - (Martijn): Fusion also has this
  - Relying on directives would be something we’d recommend over config format
  - This could live outside of schema, could be a schema extension, database
  - Some means of applying directives to an existing schema
  - (David)
  - Understanding the merit of this approach
  - Trying understand what the status is
  - (Kamil)
  - Was cumbersome - had to maintain overlay on Gateway. Boils down to ownership
  - If you have plenty of teams, it becomes a problem at some point, but not all
  - Naming is a consideration
  - (Michael) Preprocessing a custom DSL could work too - compile to
    spec-defined directives
  - (Martijn)
  - Composition rules describe how subgraphs presents itself, how it gets
    composed into an overall/federated schema
  - Also some of the details of federated execution, how to get info from one
    graph and pass it through to another. Lots of flexibility as to where
    composition happens, how it happens (query planning, what kinds of
    optimizations, transports) - lots of flexibility
  - On the topic of metadata: there’s a whole discussion to be had there - a lot
    of value and (...)
  - The way we use directives in Apollo Fed is to specify additional
    composition/runtime semantics
  - Info that other parts of composition/query planning could take advantage of
  - As soon as you open up these directives, adding more, we’ve done that w/
    Apollo Fed, there’s a possibility of name clashes, versioning, knowing a
    gateway/router can interpret those directives
  - Ideally we’d find some time to discuss an approach for that, keep it outside
    main spec for now, more general and a broader group that might be interested
  - Def on our mind
  - (Michael) also discussed in main spec group - some movement on that -
    pragmas, for instance. Namespacing
  - (Pascal) Not forbidden but may not need it depending on subgraph format
  - Mapping REST services, whatever
  - You can infer a GraphQL schema out of it, in the end you can expose it, REST
    has more capabilities than GraphQL in some areas. As long as it “looks like
    a subgraph,” the gateway can get it
  - Teams working in isolation: that’s correct. They want to work on the same
    domain. When you do Fed with a lot of microservices, that’s what we see with
    .NET, we tell them to extend types, etc.
  - (David)
  - [repeating back] this spec talks about how the subgraphs come together, but
    how you get subgraphs to be compliant is out of scope - diff tools can
    innovate along those lines, Hasura, Apollo, Mesh, etc
  - (Martijn) How do you see this approach fitting in w/ what you’re doing at
    Hasura?
  - (David) Pretty well - hadn’t considered preprocessors, seems obvious,
    Fusion, Mesh, Hasura, etc
  - Hasura works w a lot of enterprise companies who have, sometimes,
    dozens/hundreds of business domains, thousands of types, move at a glacial
    pace
  - Getting them to wrap their heads around GraphQL in the first place is a
    heavy lift
  - Just getting them onto GraphQL is an accomplishment
  - Asking them to adapt their schema is like - what?
  - (Pascal) (...) Re-shaping schema for Relay compliance, etc
  - (Kamil) already doing that, or starting doing that for Mesh - if you have a
    source, you define entrypoints, turn those into entities, if something
    requires additional logic, provide directives that land in the supergraph
  - Works great bc if you have a subgraph that is a “virtual subgraph,” in our
    case we publish to schema registry, gateway calls it - virtual-virtual, has
    a url, but just a pass-thru
  - (Michael) Again, a minimal set of rules we all agree to, moving between
    runtimes should still compose
  - (Martijn)
  - Helping to share and combine helps us educate and define best practices
  - Subgraphs are an organizational unit, a team responsible for part of the
    graph - subgraph is a contract btw that team and the overall graph
  - As part of that boundary you wouldn’t usually want ppl to just expose their
    services to the world - but there’s a mapping layer in between. Dozens of
    approaches in how you define them, workflows, runtime behavior
  - In the end, conceptually, we’re asking ppl to think carefully about what
    they’re exposing to the world and how it fits into their overall graph
- Continue Discussion about Composition Spec (20m, Pascal)
  - (Pascal) conveying Michael’s notes
  - How to structure composition a bit
  - Pre-merge validation, Actual Merge, Post-Merge validation
  - Satisfiability
  - (...)
  - Post-Merge phase needed for things like `@require` or validating fields in
    context of merged state
  - Satisfiability as the end phase
  - (Pascal) talk details, what should be in the specific sections
  - (Michael) source schema validation should not cover regular schema
    validation rules, it should expect a valid schema
  - (Micheal) reading
  - (Martijn) semantic equivalence rule may not be compliant with existing
    Apollo Federation and its `@interfaceObject`
  - (Pascal) `Dog` and `Cat`, or instance, would need to be part of the same
    `union`
  - (Michael) Field Types Mergeable could have lots of complexity
  - (more sharing of the IA of the spec and talking through what each means and
    what could be in-scope)
