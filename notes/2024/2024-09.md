## Sep 5 (Primary)

* Benjie asks about the action item of "Adding addtional test cases"
  * Michael clarifies this is an ongoing action item and can remain open
* Micahel discusses meeting updates
  * Defining composition rules
  * Submitted early draft of GraphQL Batching to the GraphQL over HTTP WG
  * Excited to see everyone at GraphQLConf next week
  * Group discussed naming
    * "GraphQL Federation" would be an acceptable name as decided by group
    * Michael reached out to Hasura and IBM to get input
    * Need to clarify with Lee to on the name to make sure it does not conflict with other names in the general landscape
    * David from Hasura joined today's meeting, Martijn asked how "GraphQL Federation" is used within Hasura's products
      * Used as a comment on the architectural pattern. In v3 this has been removed. David will convey the groups asks back internally. Does not expect contention but will update the group.
    * For at GraphQLConf, can we use this new name yet when talking about it?
      * Michael would not like to use the new name in the keynote, but in open discussion we could use a the general name as loosely defined.
      * We need to be careful not to upset other Foundation members with any name changes or conflicts
      * Benjie comments that the WG should continue to be called the "Composite Schemas WG" and we are working towards a spec that is yet to be named.
      * The WG in the future could also produce other specs that are not Federation so it would be good to keep that more open
    * The WG at the last meeting all agreed to the term because it is a generic name used by many vendors and companies and agreed by Apollo, ChilliCream, and The Guild
  * For GraphQLConf panel
    * The group would like to use Slido to have audience interaction
    * All questions reviewed last week, Jeff syncing with Danielle later
