The meeting began with introductions and a discussion of the Graph spec membership agreements and GraphQL Code of Conduct. The team then focused on specifying execution in the federation specification, debating how to describe the algorithm and query planning process. They concluded by discussing the role of directives in schema satisfiability and planning, agreeing to continue the conversation in their next meeting.

## Next Steps

- Pascal to start specifying plan options as part of the execution chapter in the specification.
- Team to continue discussing and defining rules for plan options, including how to handle provides, requires, and other directives.
- Team to determine which directives should be considered for satisfiability and which are optimizations.
- Team to decide whether provides should be included in satisfiability checks or treated as an optimization.
- Team to continue the discussion on execution and plan options in the next meeting.

## Summary

### Graph Spec Membership Agreements

In the meeting, Michael initiated a round of introductions, emphasizing the importance of the Graph spec membership agreements and the GraphQL Code of Conduct. The team discussed the AI summary and audio quality of AirPods. Pascal introduced new plans, and Kamil shared his experience with monstera plants. The team also discussed the Graph spec membership agreements and the GraphQL Code of Conduct. Michael then handed over the discussion to Pascal, who was to lead the discussion on execution.

### Specifying Execution in Federation Specification

The group discusses how to specify execution in the federation specification. They agree that the execution algorithm should be a middle ground between a production-ready implementation and a simple concept description. The algorithm should cover how execution happens, including field merging, without going into optimization details. They decide to focus on generating a possible query plan that honors satisfiability, rather than an optimal one. The group agrees to include a note stating that the algorithm is exemplary and that real-world implementations would consider additional factors. They also discuss the need to describe how downstream queries are built up and how to handle required fields that are not part of the original query. The team considers using the GraphQL execution algorithm as a basis to handle fragments and other complexities, but notes the challenge of avoiding backtracking in the specification.

### Algorithm Technical Aspects and Memory Management

The team discussed the technical aspects of their algorithm, focusing on memory management and the potential for spawning out possibilities. They also explored the idea of starting from grouped fields, which could simplify the process. The conversation touched on the challenges of handling abstract types and the need for pre-processing of documents. The team considered the possibility of reusing the whole algorithm and the importance of knowing the object type for certain operations. They also discussed the potential for competing directives and the need for a global optimal query plan.

### Sub-Query Results and Partial Responses

Pascal, Martijn, Michael, and Shane discussed the approach to fetching sub-query results and building up partial responses. They considered the potential for an explosion in requests and the possibility of optimizing the process. Shane questioned the necessity of a reference implementation or algorithm, suggesting that proving the graph's satisfiability might be sufficient. Pascal emphasized the importance of specifying how to execute the composed graph to clarify the meaning of the requirements.

### Query Execution Rules and Plan Options

The group discusses the approach to describing query execution in the specification. They agree that instead of detailing a specific algorithm, it would be better to define a set of rules that gateways must follow. Pascal suggests using plan options to simplify the process, focusing on one field at a time. This approach would cover features like provides and requires without getting into the complexities of request bundling or result composition. The team considers starting with specifying plan options as part of the execution chapter, which would reference the satisfiability chapter. They emphasize the need to describe what sub-queries must be made to resolve each field, while allowing implementers flexibility in how they achieve this efficiently.

### Provision Directive in Schema Planning

The group discusses the role of the "provides" directive in schema satisfiability and planning. They debate whether "provides" should be considered part of satisfiability or treated as an optimization. They agree that plan options need to take "provides" into account, but for satisfiability, it might be excluded. The team decides to write down rules for various directives to clarify their impact on satisfiability and planning. They conclude that further discussion is needed and agree to continue the conversation in their next meeting.
