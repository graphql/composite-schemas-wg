The meeting began with introductions and discussions about the GraphQL specification, including membership agreements and Code of Conduct. The team focused on key topics related to the specification report and schema implementation, particularly around simplifying the Federation specification and handling multiple keys for entity identification. The group explored various technical challenges and implementation approaches for node lookups, batch processing, and data structure requirements, while agreeing to continue certain discussions in the Slack channel and revisit entities in the following week.

## Next Steps

- Working Group: Specify semantics for batch lookups, including ordering requirements and null value handling
- Working Group: Define validation rules to ensure no requirements are possible in subgraphs that support batch lookups
- Michael: Prepare discussion about entities for next week's meeting
- Working Group: Consider creating an appendix or RFC for the Node interface implementation and ID format standardization
- All participants: Share thoughts about subgraph feature indication mechanisms in the Slack channel for further discussion

## Summary

### GraphQL Spec Membership Introductions

The meeting began with introductions, where Michael welcomed everyone and reminded participants of their agreement to the GraphQL spec membership agreements and Code of Conduct. Pascal, Tom, Benjamin, Martijn, Sachin, Stephen, and Shane introduced themselves, with Benjamin and Shane joining late. Michael confirmed that all necessary participants were present and ready to proceed with the agenda.

### Specification Report and Schema Updates

The team discussed several topics related to the specification report and schema implementation. Michael presented four main items for discussion, including a simplified version of the Key Directive (issue #168), relay specification node interface (issue #178), batch lookups for non-entity subgraphs, and a new abstract chapter on entity and value types. Stephen took the lead on discussing the Key Directive proposal, which aims to use a simpler definition for keys. The team agreed to focus on these topics and potentially address the fourth item if time permitted.

### Simplifying Federation Specification With Single Keys

The group discussed a proposal to simplify the Federation specification by reducing it to a single key system, removing complex keys and batch lookups. Stephen proposed this as a way to make the system simpler while maintaining compatibility with existing subgraphs through tooling that could serialize multiple keys to a single key field. Martijn and others raised concerns about the need to support multiple keys for different systems identifying the same entity, and Derek emphasized that while simple ID fields are ideal, some use cases require multiple keys. The discussion concluded with Michael noting that implementations could preprocess schemas to infer keys, while Pascal highlighted potential issues with validation rules and the node interface.

### Multiple Keys in System Identification

The team discussed the use cases for multiple keys in systems, with Martijn and Derek confirming that it's a common practice, especially in large organizations, to use multiple keys for identifying entities across different systems. Pascal provided an example of a user management system using both internal keys and legacy system employee IDs. Stephen explained that while alternate keys could be accommodated without complex keys, complex keys are necessary when a database uses multiple fields that together create a unique identifier. The team agreed that while most entities are identified by a single key, it's not uncommon to have alternate or complex keys, especially for disambiguating keys in multi-tenant systems.

### Node Lookups in Federation

The team discussed the challenges of implementing node lookups in a federated GraphQL system, particularly regarding the Relay specification. Shane explained that while the spec allows global top-level node lookups, this doesn't work well with federation since each subgraph needs to implement its own node field. Michael clarified that their Fusion implementation handles this by having each subgraph implement its own node field and using an opaque identifier system, while maintaining flexibility for gateway implementations. The group agreed that while it's possible to build such a system, they should add editorial notes in the specification to clarify that this functionality isn't natively supported in Relay and requires additional implementation work.

### GraphQL Node Interface Discussion

The group discussed the node interface pattern in GraphQL, particularly its use for object instance identity and resolving entities across different services. While acknowledging its importance, they agreed it should not be included in version 1 of the specification due to potential complexity in query planning. However, they emphasized the need for better support and documentation of this pattern, potentially as an appendix in the spec. The discussion also touched on how to handle type conditions and query planning when using the node interface, with Michael explaining their approach in Fusion of planning only for type conditions and using a fallback lookup for other cases.

### ID Format Specification Discussion

The team discussed whether to include an ID format specification in the main specification or as an appendix. Martijn proposed a simplified version that would use automatic mapping between keys and an ID format, which could be implemented more easily by users. Derek and Pascal agreed that while the ID format would be beneficial, it should not be a prerequisite for the first version of the spec, as it would expand its scope. The group decided to explore the ID format separately from the main spec development, with the possibility of incorporating it later as an appendix or RFC.

### Batch Processing Subgraph Requirements

The team discussed batch processing and requirements for subgraphs, with Martijn and Michael agreeing that complex requirements could be supported by allowing an opt-in per subgraph basis. They explored how this approach could simplify the planning algorithm and enable a mix of streaming and batch lookups, while maintaining flexibility. The discussion concluded with an acknowledgment that validation rules would be needed to ensure requirements are properly managed when disabled.

### Batch Lookup Functionality Discussion

The team discussed batch lookup functionality and data structure requirements. They agreed that arrays as identifiers should be flagged as potential user errors, but currently allow both single and array values for keys. Michael and Pascal clarified that the system currently disallows returning lists, while allowing arrays as keys with single product returns. Benjamin explained that from a graph perspective, batch lookups are detected based on output type, expecting lists for batch cases.

### Batch Mapping and Schema Semantics

The team discussed the implementation of batch and lookup mapping, with Benjamin explaining the complexity of handling different keys and auto-detection. Martijn raised concerns about the need to specify expectations for ID matching, ordering, and null values, emphasizing that these semantics are not implied by the schema and must be standardized. Pascal suggested defining a way for subgraphs to indicate feature support without configuration files, which ties into a broader discussion about generic settings indication for subgraphs. The team agreed to continue the conversation in the Slack channel and revisit entities next week.
