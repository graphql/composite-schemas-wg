The meeting began with introductions and administrative matters, followed by a discussion of field selection map syntax and its implementation details. The team explored various GraphQL features including context objects, schema names, and override mechanisms, while considering both technical implementation challenges and specification requirements. They concluded by addressing concerns about complexity in the first release and agreeing to prioritize simpler features while deferring more complex implementations to future versions.

## Next Steps

- Michael: Add specification for predictable merge order of schemas in composition
- Michael: Add clarification in the spec that field selection map uses the same whitespace rules as GraphQL
- Michael: Create issues to track list literal syntax and list assignment syntax in field selection map
- Michael: Ping Kamel regarding the potential removal of override directive from the specification
- Michael: Review where schema name is used in the specification beyond override directive

## Summary

### Meeting Introduction and Guidelines Review

The meeting began with introductions from Michael, Martijn, Pascal, Derek, and Sachin. Michael reminded attendees of the specification membership agreement, participation guidelines, and code of conduct. The group discussed the first agenda item, which Martijn introduced as a revisit of a previous topic, but no specific details were provided. The conversation ended with Michael preparing to share materials for the next discussion.

### Field Selection Map Syntax Design

The team discussed the design of field selection map syntax, particularly focusing on the use of brackets for arrays. They clarified that the syntax serves both as a description of required output data and as a transformation specification for input data. Martijn and Michael agreed that while the explicit array syntax is useful for readability, it may conflict with GraphQL's implicit array handling. Pascal noted that the syntax primarily applies to input semantics rather than output, as it indicates the need for a list type once brackets are encountered.

### Composite Schema Syntax Alignment

The team discussed syntax for composite schema selection maps, focusing on whitespace handling and list expressions. They agreed to maintain the same whitespace rules as GraphQL, allowing commas to function as whitespace without semantic meaning, despite some concerns about readability. Michael and Martijn explored the potential for using this syntax to build lists and combine properties from different sources, while Pascal raised concerns about potential abuse in subgraph parameters. The team concluded that keeping the current syntax was important for consistency with GraphQL and existing implementations.

### GraphQL Implementation Planning Discussion

The team discussed the implementation of GraphQL features, with Pascal expressing concerns about adding complexity like interfaces and objects in the first release. Martijn mentioned working on a VS Code language plugin separately. Michael proposed two action items: supporting GraphQL lists and constants, with Pascal agreeing these could be included in version one if they remain simple to implement. The team agreed to put more complex features on the backlog for future consideration.

### Context Objects Implementation Discussion

The group discussed the implementation and specification of context objects in their system. Michael suggested that while context could include functions and data collection capabilities, the specific implementation details should remain flexible. Pascal emphasized the need to be careful about specifying too much in the implementation, as it could stifle innovation. Martijn noted that they already have some context features through directives and dynamic scoping, but the exact semantics and requirements for context objects still need to be determined.

### GraphQL Specification Refinement Discussion

The team discussed several issues related to the GraphQL specification, focusing on interface objects and execution algorithms. They decided to drop an interface-related issue from v1 and refine the specification's introduction to clarify that it outlines algorithms for executing GraphQL queries on federated schemas, but does not specify full execution details. Pascal agreed to write a reply and close an issue related to execution, while Michael took responsibility for triaging another issue.

### GraphQL Schema Name Standardization Discussion

The team discussed the semantics and implementation of schema names in GraphQL, focusing on whether to include schema names directly in the specification or use directives. Michael proposed adding schema names to the specification for better usability, while Martijn suggested leaving it implementation-dependent due to the limited use of schema names in the current specification. Derek and Pascal highlighted the need for compatibility across different implementations, suggesting a directive as a practical solution. The team agreed that while standardizing schema names could provide convenience, it is not crucial for the specification's success, and further discussion is needed on the structure and semantics of schema names.

### Override Mechanism Discussion and Review

The team discussed the inclusion of the override mechanism in the specification, with Martijn and Sachin suggesting that while it should be supported for compatibility with Apollo Federation, it might be better to address migration solutions in future versions. Derek explained the concept of progressive overrides, which allows for gradual traffic shifts, and the team agreed to review the current implementation and make a decision about removing the override mechanism at the next meeting. They also touched on the need for a predictable merge order of schemas, which Michael and Derek identified as an important consideration for the specification.
