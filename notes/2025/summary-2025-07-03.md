The meeting began with administrative matters including agenda signing and agreement on various membership documents, followed by introductions from team members. The team then discussed the GraphQL specification draft for an upcoming conference, focusing on decisions about directives, key versions, and schema validation. They concluded by addressing the semantics and implementation of the "inaccessible" directive, while agreeing to handle certain validation behaviors and deprecation issues in future versions.

## Next Steps

- Michael to close the issue on simplified key version and make a note about exploring a simplified identity model in version 2.
- Michael to take feedback to Glenn about the parsing and validation of source schemas in the specification text.
- Michael to update the specification to state that schemas must be composed in a stable order without specifying what the order is.
- Michael to add a task to describe the need for a stable composition order in the specification.
- Michael to move the discussion about the new "inaccessible_object" directive to version 2 considerations.
- Michael to align the current validation behavior regarding empty types in the specification.
- Martijn and Michael to discuss the inaccessible directive behavior and semantics in the next meeting.
- Michael to flag the inaccessible directive topic for discussion in the next meeting.
- Working group to revisit the issue of key deprecation in version 2 of the specification.

## Summary

### GraphQL Team Meeting Introduction

The meeting began with Sachin explaining the process for new participants to sign the agenda by editing a file and submitting a pull request. Michael noted that Pascal would be absent, while Jeff would be late. The group agreed to the GraphQL membership agreement, participation guidelines, contribution guide, and code of conduct. They also agreed to the recording and uploading of their faces to YouTube for the meeting to be streamed. The conversation ended with introductions from Michael, Martijn, Sachin, Duckki, and Jeff.

### GraphQL Specification Draft Decisions

The team discussed the GraphQL specification draft for the next conference, focusing on decisions about the Override Directive and simplified key version. They agreed to drop the Override Directive in version 1, as confirmed by The Guild, and decided to explore a simplified identity model in future versions rather than implementing a simplified key version. Martijn expressed concerns about confusion from defining keys on multiple fields and emphasized the importance of using the main key mechanism from the start.

### GraphQL Source Schema Validation

Michael and Martijn discussed the structure and validation of source schemas in the GraphQL specification. They clarified that the specification already covers both syntactic and semantic validation of source schemas, and Martijn explained that this is consistent with the GraphQL specification. Michael suggested that a separate chapter for parcel schema might be unnecessary, but agreed to follow up with the person who proposed it to confirm their concerns.

### Schema Specification Cleanup Discussion

Michael and Martijn discussed the need to clean up the specification text regarding schemas, ensuring consistency and clarity. They agreed to leave the schema name notion out of the specification, as it is not used elsewhere, and instead focus on the stability of the order in which schemas are composed. They also decided to close certain issues related to specifying behavior and unique names, as these were deemed unnecessary for version one. Michael noted that the order of schemas and fields in compositions could lead to instability in schema snapshots, and they planned to address this by specifying that schemas must be composed in a stable order without detailing the order itself.

### GraphQL Inaccessible Directive Semantics

The team discussed the semantics and implementation of the "inaccessible" directive, particularly focusing on its application to type definitions and fields. Sachin clarified that marking all fields of a type as inaccessible currently results in a composition error, as empty types are not allowed in GraphQL. The team agreed that the current explicit behavior of the "inaccessible" directive, which requires manual marking of types and their references, is intentional to prevent accidental propagation of accessibility changes. They decided not to include the proposed new semantics for "inaccessible" on individual members in version 1 to maintain backwards compatibility.

### Validation and Deprecation Planning Discussion

The team discussed validation behavior and agreed to revisit the topic in their next meeting, with Michael planning to align current validation practices. They also addressed a key deprecation issue, deciding it should be handled in version 2 rather than version 1.1. The conversation ended with Michael noting they had covered most of the necessary discussion points and would continue in the next session.
