The meeting began with introductions and discussions about hotel work progress, with a focus on OpenTelemetry tracing for GraphQL operations and potential syntax changes for namespaces. The team explored various technical challenges related to enum values, field names, and type conditions in their GraphQL implementation, while considering different approaches to maintain compatibility with established syntax. The conversation ended with discussions about testing new features in Fusion's preview version and plans to present and gather feedback on a new feature at an upcoming GraphQL conference.

## Next Steps

- Michael to spec out the selection set map syntax with the pattern matching operator for further testing and feedback.
- Michael to share the selection set map syntax with customers for feedback.
- Michael and Martijn to have an offline discussion about what to present at GraphQLConf regarding the selection set map syntax.
- Michael to send Martijn the link to Meta's talk about identity.
- Team to consider bringing the selection set map syntax discussion to the GraphQLConf audience for feedback.
- Pascal to continue updating the team on progress in the OpenTelemetry tracing semantic conventions for GraphQL.

## Summary

### Hotel Work Group Progress Update

The meeting began with introductions and a reminder of the meeting guidelines, including the recording of sessions and the use of AI tools for summarization. Pascal mentioned progress in the hotel work group regarding specifying, but the details were not provided. The group discussed the agenda, with Michael suggesting they focus on the selection set map syntax if no additional topics were raised.

### OpenTelemetry GraphQL Tracing Improvements

Pascal discussed the current state of tracing in OpenTelemetry for GraphQL, noting that there is only one span for operation planning, which could be expanded to include two spans for operation planning and execution. He mentioned that these spans could be useful for both federated servers and advanced GraphQL servers. Pascal invited feedback from the gateway team on additional tracing needs and mentioned that links to the pull requests would be shared. Michael inquired about execution tracing, and Pascal explained that there is already a span for GraphQL Server Operation Step execution, which covers field resolution and data fetching.

### Namespace Syntax and Enum Challenges

Michael discussed with Benjie about potential changes to namespace syntax, including the possibility of using dot syntax or double colons, though the current dot syntax remains acceptable for now. They also explored the challenges with enum cases, as the team still needs to determine how to introduce illiterate functionality. Martijn suggested that the dot syntax is well-established for path traversal and should not prevent them from using it, while Michael acknowledged the need to consider user learning curves regarding new syntax.

### GraphQL Enum Disambiguation Challenges

The team discussed challenges with disambiguating enum values and field names in their GraphQL implementation, particularly when using dot notation. They explored potential solutions including starting paths with a special character, using type.name.value to disambiguate, or allowing selection from the root type. Pascal and Martijn expressed concerns about diverging too far from GraphQL's established syntax, while Michael emphasized the need to address these design issues before proceeding. The team agreed to consider various solutions while maintaining flexibility for edge cases, though they did not reach a final decision on the specific approach.

### Type Conditions and Nullability Syntax

Michael discussed the syntax and issues with type conditions and nullability in their programming language, particularly focusing on the use of a "bar" operator for type validation and scope flipping. Martijn raised concerns about the complexity of nested choice operators and the potential for unexpected behavior when type conditions are not met, while Pascal suggested that the proposed syntax could be extended to include property names and field names. The group explored the possibility of using question marks for nullability and discussed how the choice operator could be overridden or combined with other features.

### GraphQL Field Optimization Discussion

Michael and Martijn discussed the challenges of translating certain GraphQL operations into standard GraphQL selection sets, particularly focusing on the behavior of type conditions, skip, and include operators. Martijn expressed concerns about the unexpected behavior of missing fields causing the entire object construction to be discarded, which he found inconsistent with standard GraphQL execution semantics. Michael explained that this behavior is intentional and designed for optimizing data transfer, allowing users to construct input objects by discarding unnecessary data. Pascal briefly joined the conversation to clarify that this behavior occurs only when using the pipe operator.

### Pattern Matching Operator Discussion

The group discussed pattern matching operators and their similarities to existing syntax, with Pascal explaining that the proposed pattern match operator could be useful in specific scenarios where condition checking on objects with different patterns is necessary. Martijn expressed curiosity about the broader understanding of these semantics and suggested testing the concept with a larger group, while Duckki confirmed understanding by translating the concept to Rust code, though noted some potential confusion due to the syntax being "inside out" compared to typical Rust patterns.

### Fusion Feature Testing Discussion

Michael and Martijn discussed the implementation and testing of a new feature in the preview version of Fusion. They agreed that a more robust specification is needed, as the current one does not work effectively. Michael emphasized the importance of testing with concrete examples to validate the technical solution. They also discussed positive customer feedback on the dot syntax for deep nesting and injecting inputs, which Martijn found non-contentious.

### GraphQL Conference Feature Presentation

Michael and Martijn discussed plans to present and gather feedback on a new feature at an upcoming GraphQL conference. They agreed to have an offline discussion about what to include in their talk and to present concepts for audience input. Michael shared positive feedback on the lookup feature and mentioned its potential applications beyond composite schemas, referencing a similar approach used by Meta/Facebook. They also briefly discussed the importance of the uncoupling of lookup and key functionality.
