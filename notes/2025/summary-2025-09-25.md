The meeting focused on enum merging concerns and potential solutions, with Sachin presenting alternative approaches to address issues with Apollo's enum merging rules and proposing new GraphQL specification changes. The team discussed various implications of these changes, including backwards compatibility, error patterns, and the potential need for explicit changes in enum handling. They agreed to implement the proposed changes in the Composite Schema stack before attempting to integrate them into the GraphQL specification, with plans to continue the discussion in next week's meeting.

## Next Steps

- All participants to read through Sachin's proposal on enum merging with input-only and output-only directives on enum values .
- All participants to think about and discuss examples of the proposed enum merging approach in Slack or on the GitHub issue.
- Michael to add the enum merging topic to next week's meeting agenda for further discussion.
- David to check with his employer whether he's participating as an individual or through his company, and sign the spec membership agreement.

## Summary

### Enum Merging Discussion and Alternatives

The meeting focused on enum merging, with Sachin presenting concerns about the previously suggested approach and proposing an alternative solution to address pain points with Apollo's enum merging rules. He shared a spec issue (202) detailing his thoughts and requested feedback from the group. Michael reminded attendees about the GraphQL Spec Membership Agreement and participation guidelines, and introduced new members to the meeting.

### GraphQL Enum Value Alignment Concerns

Sachin expressed concerns about allowing unhandled enum values in GraphQL, noting that the client experience would be confusing if the app and schema do not align. He suggested that such cases should be clearly indicated as server errors to help with telemetry and avoid client-side confusion. Martijn and Michael discussed the potential risks of exposing unintended information and the importance of schema introspection, while Sachin emphasized that the issue might not be short-term and could occur in distributed systems with multiple teams.

### GraphQL Enum Merging Proposal Discussion

Sachin proposed a new GraphQL specification to address enum merging issues by introducing input-only and output-only directives for enum values, which would simplify enum evolution and reduce composition errors. Michael and Martijn expressed concerns about the implications of this change, particularly regarding the potential need for explicit changes and the impact on enum merging rules. Pascal suggested that the proposed solution would involve using these directives during the merging process to eliminate the "both positions" case.

### Enum Value Handling Discussion

The team discussed the handling of enum values in input and output positions, focusing on the union of non-input-only enum values for output positions and the intersection of non-output-only enum values for input positions. David raised concerns about the assumption that enum values without directives are used as both input and output, noting that this could be incorrect. The team acknowledged the lack of explicit intent for enum values used only in input or output positions, which they had previously discussed. Pascal mentioned a previous suggestion for more flexibility in enum handling, though the specific details were not clear from the transcript.

### GraphQL Enum Input/Output Proposal

The team discussed a proposal to allow enum values to be marked as input-only or output-only in the GraphQL specification, addressing issues with shared enums that require manual conversion between input and output values. Sachin explained that this would enable collapsing multiple enums into one and automatic value conversion, while David raised concerns about how this would affect unlabeled enums in large companies. Pascal clarified that the proposed functionality could be implemented through a preprocessor as part of the Composite Schema specification, and the team agreed that further discussion would be needed to determine the best approach for integrating this feature into the GraphQL specification.

### Enum Directive Handling Proposal

The team discussed a proposal for handling enum directives, focusing on input-only and output-only behaviors. Sachin explained that if no directives are specified, composition will assume the enum can be used in both input and output positions, with strict equality semantics. The group agreed this approach would be backwards compatible but might change error patterns from composition errors to runtime errors. They also discussed the potential to simplify enum management by allowing directives on individual enum values rather than at the enum level, which would eliminate the need for duplicating enum descriptions.

### GraphQL Directive Implementation Discussion

The team discussed adding new directives to the GraphQL specification, with a focus on addressing a specific pain point. They agreed to start implementing the changes in the Composite Schema stack before attempting to push them into the cross-spec. Sachin explained that the new directive would be similar to "deprecated" and appear in both schemas and introspection. The team also compared this new directive to other properties of the type system, like "one-off."

### New Problem-Solving Strategy Discussion

The team discussed a new approach to a problem, which Pascal described as a "completely new way of looking at the problem" and a "fresh idea." They agreed to add this topic to the agenda for next week's meeting. In the meantime, Pascal suggested that team members could review examples and engage in a discussion in the Slack channel, keeping the conversation public for anyone interested in joining.
