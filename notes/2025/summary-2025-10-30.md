The meeting began with discussions about time zone switches and introductions, followed by reminders about GraphQL specification requirements and documentation guidelines. The team then focused on various technical discussions including enum merging, validation rules, and error code standardization, with particular attention given to removing abbreviations and improving clarity in error messages. The conversation ended with updates on pull request merges and algorithm simplification efforts, with Pascal noting the efficient 10-minute introduction.

## Next Steps

- Pascal and team: Collect examples of different enum merging rules and combinations to explain to users simply and get everyone on the same page
- Pascal and team: Replace all instances of "arc" abbreviation with "argument" in error codes throughout the specification
- Pascal and team: Review and replace any other abbreviations found in error codes with full words
- Pascal and team: Generalize field and argument reference validation rules to have only two rules: "reference to inaccessible type" and "reference to internal type
- Team members: Review and comment on algorithmic pull requests for validation rules  before they are merged

## Summary

### GraphQL Spec Meeting Overview

The meeting began with a discussion about time zone switches, with Michael confirming that Europe had switched the previous week and waiting for another switch to occur the following Sunday. Pascal and Kamil briefly interacted in what appeared to be a mix of English and another language, discussing something about copying machines. Michael then led the meeting, reminding attendees about the GraphQL spec membership agreements, participation guidance, Code of Conduct, and contribution guide. He also mentioned that the meeting sessions would be uploaded to YouTube and that they were using LMM for summarization. The conversation ended with Michael introducing himself and noting that Martine was absent.

### Validation Rules Discussion Summary

Pascal raised a question about validation rules, particularly regarding granularity and similarity, which Michael noted for discussion. The conversation ended with no additional agenda items, and Pascal was invited to elaborate on the rules topic.

### Enum Merging Rules Discussion

The team discussed the status of enum merging, with Pascal noting they need to collect examples to better understand the merging rules and create clear user instructions. Michael confirmed they have Sasheen's proposal and are working on validation routes through pull requests, though the exact approach for including the proposal in the Composite schema remains to be determined.

### Validation Rules Naming Convention Update

Pascal and Michael discussed the finalization of a version 1 document, with a focus on addressing inconsistencies in the naming of validation rules. They agreed to align the naming convention by replacing underscores with full written words, as proposed in a Slack channel. The task was deemed easy to implement and would ensure consistency between the specification and code.

### Error Code Standardization Discussion

The team discussed changing error codes from Apollo Federation, deciding to use full words instead of abbreviations for better clarity. Michael explained the need to replace "arc" with "argument" in error codes, which Derek and Sachin supported. Pascal pointed out inconsistencies in the current error codes, such as using "arc" and "in field" in different contexts, and the team agreed to replace all abbreviations with full words.

### Error Code Abbreviation Standardization

The team discussed removing abbreviations from error codes for clarity and consistency. Derek and Sachin agreed that abbreviations should be avoided unless error codes become excessively long, in which case a shorter name might be considered. Michael noted that this was an opportunity to standardize error code naming that had previously been inconsistent.

### Type Reference Rules Consolidation Discussion

Pascal discussed the need to clarify and potentially consolidate rules related to field and argument references to inaccessible and internal types. He presented two options: generalizing the rules into broader categories or expanding them to account for specific locations where these types might occur. Pascal sought input on the direction to take, emphasizing the importance of making these rules meaningful and effective.

### Error Message Clarity Discussion

Michael and Pascal discussed the clarity of error messages in their system, particularly regarding coordinates and input/output types. Pascal pointed out that coordinates alone do not clearly indicate whether they are input or output types, which Michael acknowledged. They also touched on the current use of error codes in their system, with Pascal asking about the specific circumstances under which these codes are used.

### Schema Error Code Standardization

The team discussed error codes for schema accessibility, with Sachin explaining that while contracts can mark things inaccessible, there isn't a way to automatically mark things accessible through regular composition. Pascal inquired about the possibility of different error codes for different behaviors, but Sachin suggested that having one error code for all schemas might be more practical given the complexity of schema references. Derek noted that error messages typically include type information before the coordinate, and suggested that while the code could be generic, additional information could be included in the message if needed.

### Algorithm Simplification and Validation Discussion

The team discussed finalizing rules and algorithms, with Pascal mentioning they are simplifying to two main rules for easier validation. Michael reported merging small pull requests that addressed inconsistent examples and invited others to comment on algorithmic work, noting that pull requests can be reopened if issues are spotted. The conversation ended ahead of schedule, with Pascal acknowledging the 10-minute introduction.
