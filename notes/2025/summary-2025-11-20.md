The meeting began with administrative updates including introductions, meeting guidelines, and a reminder about upcoming holiday scheduling. The team discussed several technical proposals including error behavior propagation, service capabilities syntax, and function calls in GraphQL, with the group reaching consensus on moving forward with the new syntax despite some stylistic concerns. The conversation ended with updates on validation algorithms and a reminder about the process for raising issues on merged items.

## Next Steps

- Michael: Give feedback to Benjie that the syntax feels odd and discuss potential alternatives
- Michael: Go through validation algorithm issues over the weekend and merge them
- Team members : Raise stylistic concerns about the service capabilities syntax directly on the PR if they feel compelled to do so

## Summary

### GraphQL Spec Meeting Guidelines

The meeting began with introductions and a reminder from Michael about the GraphQL Spec Membership Agreement, participation guidelines, contribution guide, and code of conduct. He noted that meetings are typically recorded and published on YouTube, with LNM providing summaries. Michael also mentioned that there would be no meeting next week due to Thanksgiving in the US.

### GraphQL Error Propagation Discussion

The team discussed a new error behavior in GraphQL where errors are not propagated upwards and fields can be null even if they're not null. Michael presented a proposal for service capabilities to enable clients to inspect this new behavior, which would be particularly useful for the Composite schema. The team agreed to continue the discussion on this topic, with Michael planning to provide more examples of service capabilities.

### GraphQL Syntax Decision Meeting

The team discussed the new GraphQL service capabilities syntax, comparing the original key-value pair proposal with the current syntax using parentheses. While some team members preferred the clarity of the original proposal, they agreed that the new syntax, while unconventional, would work for their needs. Michael explained that the new syntax would enable better description of capabilities like error behavior and batch processing, which would be useful for the Composite Schema specification. The team approved moving forward with the new syntax.

### GraphQL Function Call Syntax Discussion

The team discussed a new feature involving function calls in GraphQL, with Pascal and Kamil expressing concerns about the syntax while acknowledging its potential benefits for parsing and namespaces. Michael noted that while the syntax felt unusual, it provided new capabilities and could be discussed further with Benjie. Derek agreed that while the syntax was different from other systems, it was still an improvement over the current approach. The team considered the readability of SDLs and discussed whether they preferred the new format despite its potential ambiguities.

### System Capabilities and Validation Discussion

The group discussed the capabilities of a proposed system, agreeing that it meets their needs for expressing capabilities, despite some stylistic concerns. They decided that any issues with the proposed syntax should be raised in the main working group rather than the Composite Schema Working Group. Michael mentioned that they are currently going through validation algorithms and fixing various issues in the spec repo, with more fixes planned for the weekend. The conversation ended with a reminder that participants can always raise issues on merged items if they have concerns.
