# Introduction

As a stepping stone towards building blocks that will allow us to facilitate
different types of schema composition, the below represents an attempt to
summarize the current known state of subschema composability.

# Nomenclature

This RFC will adopt the language suggested at our first WG of referring to each
individual smaller schema as a "subschema," which may or may not be executable,
with the composed schema referred to as the "composite schema." The following
terms will be avoided by this RFC until consensus is achieved on a specific
meaning that enhances the lexicon: "schema merging," "schema stitching," "schema
federation," "type federation, "type merging."

Additionally, the below terms are uses as follows:

## `Overlapping`

The term `overlapping` will be used to refer to a situation where different
subschemas define GraphQL elements (such as types, fields, arguments, etc) that
each map to the same entity (type, field, argument) etc. in the composite
schema. In the na√Øve situation, these overlapping elements are known to be
overlapping simply because they have the same name. However, as mentioned during
our first WG, a method of composition may be devised in which elements in
different subschemas with different names are mapped to the same element in the
composite schema via some set of guiding metadata.

## `Composability`

For a given set of subschemas, it may be possible to generate a valid
`composite schema` that contains all GraphQL elements of all of the individual
subschemas. This set of subschemas is then considered to be `composable`.
Inversely, it may be impossible to generate a valid composite schema containing
all of the GraphQL elements of a given set of subschemas; this set of subschemas
is considered `not composable`.

For a given set of subschemas and a given set of overlapping GraphQL elements
(e.g. types, fields, arguments, etc.), it may be possible to generate a valid
`composite` GraphQL element containing all of the overlapping GraphQL elements'
constituent GraphQL sub-element across all of the individual subschemas. This
GraphQL element is `composable` across the given set of overlapping elements. A
set of subschemas is `composable` if and only if each of its overlapping GraphQL
elements are `composable`.

# Types of Composition

Many types of schema composition exist, with potential distinctions including
(but not limited to):

## Timing of Composition

1. "Build-time" composition in which the composite schema is created during a
   build process prior to system start-up.
2. "Run-time" composition in which the composite schema is created dynamically
   at system start-up.
3. "Dynamic" composition, in that subschemas are polled by a managing service
   (or report changes to a managing service), such that the composition process
   can be triggered at or after system start-up and that the composite schema is
   dynamically refreshed as the subschemas change (or go offline!).

## Method of Composite Schema Execution

1. `Subschemas as remote GraphQL services`: in certain forms of composition
   (gateways, gateway schemas, etc.), the execution of a request against a
   composite schema will yield request(s) against spec-compliant (or even
   non-spec compliant) GraphQL subservices that are then merged into a single
   request.
2. `Single-service composite schema execution`: Often, especially when utilizing
   "build-time" composition, a single service executes the composite schema
   without delegation to remote services tied to each subschema. Subschemas
   exist for the purpose of code organization, but only the composite schema
   exists at the time of execution.

The below RFC is meant to be useful across all varieties of schema composition.
Because all forms of schema composition require a composite schema, we can speak
of "composability" without referring to the timing of composition or the type of
execution. However, practically speaking, the method of composite schema
execution matters significantly (much more than the timing of composition). For
example, if a request against the composite schema must ultimately be translated
to request(s) against the still extant source subschemas, then the composition
must be -- in some sense -- reversed during execution, which is not always
possible, and introduces significant complexity.

The below RFC examines composability separately for the above two forms of
composite schema execution.

# Techniques for Maintaining Composability

## `Namespacing`

A set of potentially "overlapping" types in subschemas may be considered to have
been "namespaced" if they have been adjusted in some way so as to longer be
overlapping. For example, identically named types in different subschemas may be
namespaced by utilizing some form of metadata to map the identically named types
to different types in the composite schema. Or, when metadata denotes types as
overlapping in the first instance, namespacing may be accomplished simply by
adjusting the existing metadata or via additional metadata. Finally, a new
namespace construct may be introduced into the GraphQL specification itself such
that, for example, multiple, different types with the same name could be
organized into separate namespaces without conflict. In any of these situations,
the "namespaced" GraphQL elements no longer overlap and no longer _require_
composition; there is therefore no impediment to composability.

## `Transforms`

Namespacing is one way in which subschemas may be adjusted prior to composition.
More broadly, schemas may be transformed in many ways, many of which may impact
composition. Types, fields, enum values, etc., for example, can be renamed,
removed, or added, sometimes allowing a set of previously non composable
subschemas to become composable. When execution involves requests against the
subschemas as remote GraphQL services, the subschema transformation may also
require runtime transformation of the requests to the subservices and/or the
subservice results.

# Composability by Type

## Scalars

1. The specified scalars (Int, Float, String, Boolean, ID) can each be composed
   across subschemas, because they are identical in all subschemas.
2. Custom scalars can be composed across subschemas, _as long as the
   parsing/serialization of values is performed in the identical manner across
   all subschemas._
   - This important condition/qualification may be difficult to verify!
   - The `specifiedByURL` field may be helpful in this regard.

## Enums

1. Overlapping enum types where the types define identical sets of values can
   always be composed, as they are identical in all subschemas.
2. Subschemas with overlapping enum types where the disparate types define
   different value sets are only sometimes composable.
   - If the enum types are used only in output types, the enum types can be
     composed as a union of values from all subschemas.
   - If the enum types are used in input types:
     - When using `Subschemas as remote GraphQL services`, the enum types cannot
       be composed.
     - When using `Single-service composite schema execution`, the resolvers for
       those fields attached to each must:
       - have access to the composite type, or
       - have access to all of the relevant enum values necessary to properly
         resolve the field.

## Input Object Types

1. Overlapping input object types cannot be composed if any overlapping input
   fields cannot be composed, see below.
2. If some of the input object types define fields not defined by the other
   overlapping types:
   - When using `Subschemas as remote GraphQL services`, the types cannot be
     composed.
     - The fields of these input objects will no longer affect the execution of
       portions of the subschema, in ways that may be unpredictable for users of
       the composite schema.
   - When using `Single-service composite schema execution`:
     - If the input object types are used within subschema field arguments, the
       resolvers for those fields attached to each must:
       - have access to the composite type, or
       - have access to all of the fields necessary to properly resolve the
         field.
     - Otherwise, the types cannot be composed.

## Input Object Fields

1. Overlapping input object fields can be composed as long as the fields have
   the same type, allowing for variations in nullability.
2. If any of the overlapping input field types is non-nullable and without a
   default value, the composed input field type must be non-nullable.
3. If the overlapping input field types are list types of any depth and the item
   type at a given depth for any given subschema is non-nullable, the item type
   at that depth within the composite schema must be non-nullable.
4. Overlapping input field types with different default values can be composed,
   with the default value for the field within the composite schema not
   specified.

## Object Types

1. Overlapping object types cannot be composed if any overlapping fields cannot
   be composed, see below.

## Object Fields

1. Overlapping object fields may be composable if all overlapping arguments are
   composable and all fields have the same type, allowing for variations in
   nullability.
   - When using `Subschemas as remote GraphQL services`:
     - Overlapping fields may facilitate the minimization of subschemas
       requests.
     - All field arguments must overlap; if a field in one schema is not defined
       in another, the argument will no longer affect the execution of field in
       the other subschema, in ways that may be unpredictable for users of the
       composite schema
   - When using `Single-service composite schema execution`, the use case for
     overlapping fields is not obvious!
2. If any of the overlapping field types is nullable, the composed field must be
   nullable.
3. If the overlapping field types are list types of any depth and the item type
   at a given depth for any given subschema is nullable, the item type at that
   depth within the composite schema must be nullable.

## Field Arguments

1. Overlapping arguments can be composed as long as the arguments have the same
   type, allowing for variations in nullability.
2. If any of the overlapping arguments is non-nullable and without a default
   value, the composed argument type must be non-nullable.
3. If the overlapping arguments have list types of any depth and the item type
   at a given depth for any given subschema is non-nullable, the item type at
   that depth within the composite schema must be non-nullable.
4. Overlapping arguments with different default values can be composed, with the
   default value for the argument within the composite schema not specified.

## Interface Types

1. Overlapping interface types cannot be composed if any overlapping fields
   cannot be composed, see below.

## Interface Fields

1. Overlapping interface fields can be composed if all arguments overlap, all
   arguments are composable (see above), and all fields have the same type,
   allowing for variations in nullability.
   - When using `Subschemas as remote GraphQL services`, overlapping interface
     fields may facilitate the minimization of subschemas requests.
   - When using `Single-service composite schema execution`, overlapping
     interface fields may be helpful for type safety, although this is not
     obvious!
2. If any of the overlapping field types is nullable, the composed field must be
   nullable.
3. If the overlapping field types are list types of any depth and the item type
   at a given depth for any given subschema is nullable, the item type at that
   depth within the composite schema must be nullable.

## Union Types

1. Overlapping union types are composable.
   - The composed type within the composite schema should include the union of
     all possible types defined by each of the overlapping types.
